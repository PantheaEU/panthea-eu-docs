### What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain can be described as a digital ledger maintained by a set of validators that remains correct even if some of the validators (less than a third) are malicious. Each party stores a copy of the ledger on their computer and updates it according to the rules defined by the protocol when they receive blocks of transactions. The goal of blockchain technology is to make sure the ledger is correctly replicated, meaning that each honest party sees the same version of the ledger at any given moment.

The main benefit of blockchain technology is the ability for parties to share a ledger without having to rely on a central authority. Blockchains are **decentralized**. The first and most famous application of blockchain technology today is Bitcoin, a decentralized currency.
